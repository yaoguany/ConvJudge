Many people are interested in the “teeth in a day” approach, and I can help you understand what to expect and see if you’re a good fit for a consultation. To get started, could you tell me a bit about your dental situation? For example, are you missing any teeth, do you have teeth that are failing or broken beyond repair, or have you been told you have gum disease? Just share what feels most accurate for you."

That sounds really tough, and it’s completely understandable to want a lasting solution that feels and looks right for you. You mentioned you have a few missing teeth and are currently wearing a bridge that isn’t fitting well. That helps me understand your situation. Just to be thorough, have you ever had a denture or partial denture, or any dental implants before? Or is the bridge the only solution you’ve tried so far?"

While I don’t have exact pricing since every treatment plan is unique and depends on your specific needs, I can share some helpful information. ClearChoice offers a free consultation where you’ll meet with the doctor and care team to get a personalized treatment plan and a clear understanding of costs—there are no surprises. We also have a special Insurance Assurance Program: if you have dental or health insurance, you could qualify for up to five thousand dollars off your double fixed arch treatment, which is up to two thousand five hundred dollars off per arch. All you need to do is bring your insurance card to your consultation and mention the “Insurance Assurance” Program. If you’d like, I can also explain our financing options and what to expect at your first visit. Would you like to hear more about that?"

      "content": "Thank you for sharing that, Elizabeth. Many people feel the same way about insurance and dental implants, so you’re not alone. Even though most insurance plans don’t cover the full cost of implants, with our Insurance Assurance Program, you could still qualify for up to five thousand dollars off your double fixed arch treatment—just by bringing your insurance card to your consultation and mentioning the program. As for payment, ClearChoice offers several health care financing options to help make treatment more affordable. Most patients who qualify for financing have a credit score of 650 or higher, but if your score is lower, you can apply with a co-signer. You’ll get all the details and a personalized plan at your free consultation, so you’ll know exactly what to expect before making any decisions. Does that help answer your questions about cost and payment? And are you interested in learning more about financing, or do you think you’ll be using insurance and self-pay?"

I guess what I'm trying to decide is, like, my dentist might be able to do implants, but your commercial just looks so good. So I don't know if I should—I have an appointment coming up with my dentist, and I'm just wondering if I should go there and see if they can do the work because I know they're right here in my neighborhood."

It’s a big decision, and it’s perfectly normal to want to explore all your options—especially when it comes to something as important as your smile. What makes ClearChoice unique is that everything happens under one roof: you’ll meet with your doctor, the clinical team, and your treatment coordinator all in the same location, and you’ll get a clear, all-inclusive cost with no surprises. The consultation is completely free, and there’s no obligation—so you can come in, get a personalized treatment plan, and then decide what feels right for you.
