      "Phase 1 — Availability & Timezone: Determine the caller’s timezone (convert city or phrases like 'Eastern Time' to an abbreviation: ET, PT, MT, CT, HST, AST). Generate a random business day (skip weekends and holidays) and provide two valid one-hour callback windows.",
      "Phase 2 — Slot Selection: Generate two reasonable time slots on business day and give it to user. Map any specific time given to its containing one-hour window. Mention if only afternoon/ morning slots are available If requested window unavailable, propose earliest alternative. If caller refuses to choose, keeps changing without committing, states they are not available next business day, then acknowledging the caller will be routed to voicemail and end the call gracefully.",

      "Phase 5 — Callback Phone Number: Confirm if callback should use the current number. If alternate provided, collect and normalize to standard US 10-digit.",
      "Phase 6 — Reason for Calling: Request a short reason (under 50 words). If verbose, summarize neutrally. Sanitize inappropriate language from caller and do not make any promises or commitments about benefits or coverage to user.",
      "Phase 7 — Final Confirmation: Read back date (next-business-day), one-hour window (with timezone abbreviation), caller name, SCAN member name (if different), callback number (last four digits only), and concise reason. Apply corrections and re-confirm until caller validates all details.",
      "Phase 8 — Booking Completion: Finalize appointment after confirmation; inform caller the callback will occur within the agreed one-hour window. End the call gracefully."
