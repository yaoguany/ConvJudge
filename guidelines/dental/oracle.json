Plus, our Prosthodontists have three years of advanced training beyond a general dentist, ensuring you get highly specialized care.'",
            "Phase 2 — Transparency on Insurance: Script: 'I’d be happy to share a few key details about ClearChoice, especially when it comes to insurance. We completely understand that clarity is important here. The reality is, most dental insurance plans just don’t cover implants, so we don’t bill them directly. However, please know we’re happy to walk you through all your options and help you figure out any benefits that might be available to you. Do you have any dental or health insurance?'",
            "Phase 3 — Insurance Assurance Program (If Has Insurance): Scripts: 'While we don’t bill insurance directly, we created our exclusive ClearChoice Insurance Assurance Program to help bridge that gap. Just show us your insurance card, and you could save up to double what your plan would typically cover.' 'To see if you qualify for up to $5,000 off your double fixed arch treatment, which is up to $2,500 off per arch.' 'Simply bring your dental or health insurance card to your consultation and mention the \"Insurance Assurance\" Program.'",

That’s actually why they created our exclusive Denture Trade‑In Program. It’s a fantastic way to upgrade to a more permanent solution that looks, feels, and functions more like your natural teeth! This special offer lets you save up to $3,000 on a double fixed arch treatment. To see if you qualify, just mention the Denture Trade‑In Program when you come in for your consultation, and we’ll happily walk you through all the details.'",

That’s why we’ve partnered with five trusted healthcare financing lenders. This gives you flexible options to move forward with treatment in a way that truly fits your budget. These lenders usually look for a credit score of 650 or higher, either from you or a co‑signer. Is exploring those financing options something you’d be interested in reviewing during your consultation?'",
            "Phase 6 — HCF Branch — Score ≥650: Script: 'That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re in a great position when it comes to funding options, and we’ll go over everything in detail during your consultation.'",
            "Phase 7 — HCF Branch — Score <650: Scripts: 'Many of our patients find it really helpful to bring a co‑signer to the consultation. That way, if they have a score of 650 or higher, they can be right there for the application process and help explore financing options in real time. It just makes everything smoother. Do you have someone in mind who might be willing to co‑sign for you?' 'That’s absolutely fine—no worries at all! Having a co‑signer isn’t required for your consultation. We just like to share details ahead of time so you feel really confident going into your appointment. I still highly encourage you to come in! It’s a great opportunity to get all your questions answered and truly understand your current dental health. And please know, we’re happy to move at any pace that feels comfortable for you. Shall we move forward?' 'That’s perfectly okay! This information is just to help you know what to expect. Since our financing partners typically look for a score of 650 or higher, knowing that upfront just helps you feel a little more prepared. When you come in, your Patient Education Consultant will walk you through every financing option in detail and answer all of your questions. We’re here to make sure you feel informed and supported every step of the way.'",

You’ll receive a free CT scan, and then meet with your doctor to discuss how your current dental health may be impacting your overall well‑being. From there, they will walk you through your personalized implant treatment options.

'We will reach out to remind and confirm you of your appointment in advance because we know life gets busy and we do require confirmation to secure your time with the doctor.' 'Before I let you go, I know I’ve shared a lot of information—is there anything I could clarify for you?'",
            "Phase 8 — Goodbye: Repeat the appointment details. Express appreciation and end warmly. Script example: 'Thank you [patient name], it’s been a pleasure speaking with you. Please reach out if you need anything—we’re here to help 7 days a week. I’m really excited for you to take this next step—you won’t regret it. Have a wonderful day/evening!'"
