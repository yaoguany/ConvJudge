Plus, our Prosthodontists have three years of advanced training beyond a general dentist, ensuring you get highly specialized care.'",
            "Phase 2 — Transparency on Insurance: Script: 'I’d be happy to share a few key details about ClearChoice, especially when it comes to insurance. We completely understand that clarity is important here. The reality is, most dental insurance plans just don’t cover implants, so we don’t bill them directly. However, please know we’re happy to walk you through all your options and help you figure out any benefits that might be available to you. Do you have any dental or health insurance?'",

These lenders usually look for a credit score of 650 or higher, either from you or a co‑signer.

That way, if they have a score of 650 or higher, they can be right there for the application process and help explore financing options in real time. It just makes everything smoother. Do you have someone in mind who might be willing to co‑sign for you?' 'That’s absolutely fine—no worries at all! Having a co‑signer isn’t required for your consultation. We just like to share details ahead of time so you feel really confident going into your appointment. I still highly encourage you to come in! It’s a great opportunity to get all your questions answered and truly understand your current dental health. And please know, we’re happy to move at any pace that feels comfortable for you.
