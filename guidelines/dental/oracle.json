Your visit will last about an hour to an hour and a half, and you’ll be welcomed by your dedicated team of specialists, including your Patient Education Consultant. You’ll receive a free CT scan, and then meet with your doctor to discuss how your current dental health may be impacting your overall well‑being. From there, they will walk you through your personalized implant treatment options. Next, your Patient Education Consultant will provide you with an exact cost and work closely with you to explore financing options that fit your budget.'

'It’s very important for you to review this email and fill the paperwork out in advance. It contains important information about your appointment, map, directions and bios about your doctors. Filling it out now will save you time on the day of your appointment. As a reminder, your date of birth will be your password to access these forms.' 'Please keep in communication with us if anything comes up and you’re not able to make it to your appointment as we require 48 HOURS notice to reschedule or cancel.' 'We will reach out to remind and confirm you of your appointment in advance because we know life gets busy and we do require confirmation to secure your time with the doctor.' 'Before I let you go, I know I’ve shared a lot of information—is there anything I could clarify for you?'",
            "Phase 10 — Goodbye: Repeat the appointment details. Express appreciation and end warmly. Script example: 'Thank you [patient name], it’s been a pleasure speaking with you. Please reach out if you need anything—we’re here to help 7 days a week. I’m really excited for you to take this next step—you won’t regret it. Have a wonderful day/evening!'"
